<h1>Hallucinated Citations</h1>

<p>
‘Hallucinated citations’ and ‘phantom references’ are citations and references invented by Large Language Models (LLMs) that look real but don’t exist. They’re a creative combination of author names, paper titles, journal names and publication years that mimic genuine publications but in reality are completely fictional.
</p>

<p>
We scanned each paper for hallucinated citations and AI-generated text.
